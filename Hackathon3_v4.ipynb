PEFT offers a more resource-efficient way to adapt models while achieving evaluation results that are comparable to full fine-tuning, as you’ll observe shortly.\n",
        "\n",
        "PEFT is an umbrella term encompassing methods like **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** and prompt tuning (distinct from prompt engineering). In most cases, when referring to PEFT, the focus is typically on LoRA. LoRA enables fine-tuning of models with significantly reduced computational demands—often requiring as little as a single GPU. Instead of modifying the original large language model (LLM), LoRA fine-tuning creates a compact \"LoRA adapter,\" which is tailored to a specific task or application. This adapter is much smaller than the original LLM, typically occupying only a fraction of its size (e.g., megabytes compared to gigabytes).\n",
        "\n",
        "During inference, the LoRA adapter is merged back with the original LLM to process requests. The key advantage here is that a single LLM can support multiple tasks by leveraging different LoRA adapters, minimizing the overall memory footprint when serving diverse use cases. This modularity makes LoRA an efficient and scalable solution for fine-tuning large models."

With this approach, the underlying LLM remains frozen, and only the adapter is trained. Below is an example of the LoRA configuration, which includes the rank (`r`) hyperparameter. This parameter specifies the dimensionality or rank of the adapter being trained. Adjusting `r` allows you to control the complexity and size of the adapter."
